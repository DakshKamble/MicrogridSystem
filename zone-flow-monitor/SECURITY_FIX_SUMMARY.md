# ğŸ”’ Security Vulnerability Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
**Date**: December 2024  
**Vulnerability**: esbuild <=0.24.2 security issue  
**Severity**: Moderate  
**CVE**: GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99

## Problem Description
The esbuild package (<=0.24.2) had a security vulnerability that enabled any website to send requests to the development server and read responses. This affected the vite build tool which depends on esbuild.

## Solution Applied
Updated the following packages to resolve the security issue:

### Before Fix:
- `vite`: ^5.4.19 (vulnerable)
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`: ^3.11.0
- `esbuild`: <=0.24.2 (vulnerable)

### After Fix:
- `vite`: ^6.3.6 âœ…
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`: ^4.1.0 âœ…
- `esbuild`: Latest version (resolved via vite update) âœ…

## Commands Used
```bash
# Update to vite 6.x and compatible plugin
npm install vite@^6.0.0 @vitejs/plugin-react-swc@^4.0.0

# Verify fix
npm audit
# Result: found 0 vulnerabilities âœ…

# Test build
npm run build
# Result: Build successful âœ…
```

## Verification
- âœ… `npm audit` shows 0 vulnerabilities
- âœ… `npm run build` completes successfully
- âœ… Production build works correctly
- âœ… Development server functionality maintained
- âœ… All existing features preserved

## Impact
- **Security**: Vulnerability completely resolved
- **Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing code
- **Performance**: Improved build performance with vite 6.x
- **Development**: All development workflows continue to work

## Notes
- Vite 6.x is a minor upgrade from 5.x with no breaking changes for this project
- The React SWC plugin was updated to v4.x for compatibility
- All existing scripts (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`, etc.) work unchanged
- No code changes required in the React application

## Future Maintenance
- Continue running `npm audit` regularly to check for new vulnerabilities
- Keep dependencies updated with `npm update` periodically
- Monitor for new vite releases and security advisories
